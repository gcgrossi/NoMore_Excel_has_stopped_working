    "# How to get a constant stream of data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous episode [add link] we saw how to setup your environment and getting started very quickly with Eikon API for python. In few steps we were able to generate and app key and retrieve the live quote for a couple of instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that in order to be able to get information from the API we must know the specific codes from Eikon. Unfortunately this is one of the difficulties in programming your Python applications with Eikon, but once you experiment a little bit with the API you will quickly gain knowledge of the codes and start navigating very easily. As always happens in coding, when learning something new you should get the hands dirty first!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the financial applications are aimed to monitor the current market data during a period of time. In example, a trading system would want to be able to compute some indicators, run prediction models and generate trading signal in a 'live' manner. This means that there should be a calculation engine that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- runs persistenly in background.\n",
    "- fetches data.\n",
    "- manipulates them.  \n",
    "- generate trading signal.\n",
    "- act on the trading signal or send a notification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something that can hardly be achieved in Excel. With Excel you can, in example have a spreadsheet opened in the background that is constantly running, but the solution will end up being very inefficient, with a lot of errors and crashes. Moreover, a problem with parallelization and threading will arise. Meaning that running multiple, concurrent jobs will be almost impossible to realize. You can still try to find a workaround, by running a master job that handles opening different workbooks but I doubt you're going to be still in good mental health after building such a framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truth is that Excel was not made for this purpose. Python is a way better tool to handle these kind of jobs, and with the Eikon API you can create a very powerful live data processing station. Let's see how to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A first naive approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw we can retrieve the quote for an instrument using the method ```get_data```. This will return the last quote in the memory cache of the system. Naively, if we repeat the call each x seconds we have a first way of fetching the information we need constantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved very easily in Python with the code below. "

    "We will exploit a new method of the API called ```Streaming Prices```. The method is similar to ```get_data```, it accepts the same inputs (a list of instrument codes and a list of fields to retrieve) but in addition it supports event handling. This means that when a certain event happens (i.e.a new field is updated) the information contained in the event can be passed to a function and you can use is for your purposes. \n",
