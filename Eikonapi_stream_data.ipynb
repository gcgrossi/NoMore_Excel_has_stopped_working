    "# How to get a constant stream of data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous episode](https://gcgrossi.github.io/NoMore_Excel_has_stopped_working/Eikonapi_getting_started/) we saw how to set up your environment and get started very quickly with Eikon API for python. In a few steps, we were able to generate an app key and retrieve the live quote for a couple of instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that to be able to get information from the API we must know the specific codes from Eikon. Unfortunately, this is one of the difficulties in programming your Python applications with Eikon, but once you experiment a little bit with the API you will quickly gain knowledge of the codes and start navigating very easily. As always happens in coding, when learning something new you should get your hands dirty first!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most financial applications are aimed to monitor the current market data during a period. For example, a trading system would want to be able to compute some indicators, run prediction models and generate a trading signal in a 'live' manner. This means that there should be a calculation engine that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- runs persistently in the background.\n",
    "- fetches data.\n",
    "- manipulates them.  \n",
    "- generate a trading signal.\n",
    "- act on the trading signal or send a notification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something that can hardly be achieved in Excel. With Excel you can, for example, have a spreadsheet opened in the background that is constantly running, but the solution will end up being very inefficient, with a lot of errors and crashes. Moreover, a problem with parallelization and threading will arise. Meaning that running multiple, concurrent jobs will be almost impossible to realize. You can still try to find a workaround, by running a master job that handles opening different workbooks but I doubt you're going to be still in good mental health after building such a framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truth is that Excel was not made for this purpose. Python is a way better tool to handle these kinds of jobs, and with the Eikon API, you can create a very powerful live data processing station. Let's see how to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## ```get_data```\n",
    "We will use this method, which returns a ```pandas.DataFrame``` with fields in columns and instruments as row index. The input parameters are summarized in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Type | Description |\n",
    "| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n",
    "| instruments | string or list | Single instrument or list of instruments to request. |\n",
    "|fields | string, dictionary or list of strings and/or dictionaries.|List of fields to request. Examples: ```'TR.PriceClose' {'TR.GrossProfit': { 'params':{ 'Scale': 6, 'Curn': 'EUR' }}{'TR.GrossProfit': { 'params':{ 'Scale': 6, 'Curn': 'EUR'},sort_dir:'desc'} ['TR.PriceClose','TR.PriceOpen'][{'TR.PriceClose':{'sort_dir':asc,sort_priority:1}},{'TR.PriceOpen':{'sort_dir':asc,sort_priority:0}}```. You can use the function ```TR_Field``` to build the fields: ``` >>> fields =[ek.TR_Field('tr.revenue'),ek.TR_Field('tr.open','asc',1),ek.TR_Field('TRGrossProfit',{'Scale': 6, 'Curn': 'EUR'},'asc',0)] >>> data, err = ek.get_data([\"IBM\",\"MSFT.O\"],fields).```\n",
    " | parameters| string or dictionary, optional| Single global parameter key=value or dictionary of global parameters to request. The default is None.|\n",
    "|field_name| boolean, optional|Define if column headers are filled with field name or display names. If ```True``` value, field names will be used as column headers. Otherwise, the full display name will be used. The default is ```False```.|\n",
    "|raw_output| boolean, optional| By default, the output is a  ```pandas.DataFrame```. Set raw_output=True to get data in JSON format. The default is ```False```.|\n",
    "|debug |bool| When set to ```True```, the JSON request and response are printed. The default value is ```False```.|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "**pandas.DataFrame**\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns ```pandas.DataFrame``` with fields in columns and instruments as row index\n",

    "**errors**\n",

    "Returns a list of errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raises\n",
    "**Exception**\n",
    "\n",
    "If http request fails or if server returns an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ValueError**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a parameter type or value is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A first naive approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw we can retrieve the quote for an instrument using the method ```get_data``` discussed previously. This will return the last quote in the memory cache of the system. Naively, if we repeat the call each x seconds we have a first way of fetching the information we need constantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved very easily in Python with the code below. "

During this dead time, if the price of the instrument changes, we will not be able to catch the change. This is not ideal for all those applications that need quick in-time responses.\n",

    "Ideally, we would like to receive an update each time new data arrives on the server and perform our calculations asynchronously (i.e. process the data in a different/parallel thread), before receiving new updates. Fortunately, this is achievable by using a built-in method of the Eikon API. Let's see how.\n",

    "# A second, more efficient, approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will exploit a new method of the API called ```Streaming Prices```. The method is similar to ```get_data```, it accepts the same inputs (a list of instrument codes and a list of fields to retrieve) but in addition, it supports event handling. This means that when a certain event happens (i.e.a new field is updated) the information contained in the event can be passed to a function and you can use it for your purposes. \n",
