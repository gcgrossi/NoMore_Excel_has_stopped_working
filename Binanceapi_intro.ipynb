    "# The Binance API\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Crypto is the new thing. Well, not new since it’s been sometime now that is more than this. Crypto is a reality, established and accepted by many. The more the time passes, the more cryptocurrencies are present in the portfolios of several investors, from retail to institutional. Many banks and other financial institutions have opened new crypto services, providing solutions to hold and exchange these assets. The first ETFs are popping out, and regulators are faced with the reality of incorporating cryptocurrencies into the present financial rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, I think it’s nice to dedicate a part of this guide to explaining how to get data for cryptocurrencies since most of the time the APIs are free and the Defi Exchanges providing data are well designed and extremely easy to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "I hold some crypto too, via the most famous and big exchange in the world, Binance. I have an account that you can set up for free. I also ‘discovered’ that Binance has a super well-documented API that, with relatively simple HTTP requests, lets you interact with the exchange in many ways: you can simply consult the market data or get historical market prices. You can also interact with your wallet, consult the balance, and place market orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you can do all the things you do with your smartphone application but with the power of coding your actions and with all the benefits that come with it: automation, control, and calculation power.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here I am, trying to explain a bit how to connect this service with our favorite programming language, Python! 🐍\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The full documentation can be found [here](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/) and I will try to distill the main concepts for you, as well as guide you to its usage in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need my help because here comes the first thing we have to notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is no official python code for the API** 😱\n",
    "\n",
    "No simple ```.get_quote()``` method to obtain your data in pandas DataFrames! This is not so tragic in the end, on the contrary! It’s a fantastic occasion to practice basic python libraries, which are the everyday food of the developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API must be interrogated with an HTTP request, and the response is always in JSON format, so you have the chance to practice with the requests and JSON library, as well as manipulating python dictionaries. There are a couple of things before performing our very first (and super-easy) request:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the basic URL to perform the requests is: https://api.binance.com, but there are also other fallback URLs if there are performance issues:\n",
    "    1. https://api1.binance.com\n",
    "    2. https://api2.binance.com\n",
    "    3. https://api3.binance.com\n",
    "- All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.\n",
    "- Data is returned in ascending order. Oldest first, newest last.\n",
    "- All-time and timestamp-related fields are in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of requests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 different security levels, requiring authentication depending on the type of endpoint we are querying. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Free Endpoints**: marked as Security Type ```NONE``` they do not require any kind of authentication.\n",
    "2. **API key Endpoints**: marked as Security type ```USER_STREAM``` or ```MARKET_DATA``` they require the creation of an API key from your Binance account. So yes, you need to open a Binance account to retrieve the data!\n",
    "3. **API key + Signed Endpoints**: marked as Security type ```TRADE``` or ```MARGIN``` or ```USER_DATA``` they require both an API key and a cryptographic signature to be sent with the request. As you can see, they allow to consult personal information and doing actual trading so they need the highest possible security. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this said we can start playing a little bit with the API using the free endpoints before moving to more advanced features, just to have a feeling of how to work with this API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ping the Server\n",
    "\n",
    "we can ping the server to see if it's up or to test the connectivity speed."

In this case, the request must be formulated by adding the symbol/symbols option in the request body. With the request library, you can do this in two ways.
