    "In the previous Episodes we saw how could we obtain data from Eikon using the Python API to connect to its Terminal. We saw it was very easy and straightforward to obtain a constant stream of information or the historic data for a particular financial instrument, using an app key and the API methods.\n",

    "I spent a lot of nice words praising the ease of connection and the simplicity of the APIâ€™s design. The time has come to see the flip of the coin. I will introduce it by telling you a story."
