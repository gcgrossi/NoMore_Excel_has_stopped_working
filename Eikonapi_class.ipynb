    "# The Eikon API\n",
    "## Create a Python Class to hold all the functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to get a little bit more technical! After 4 Episodes I guess we are ready to ramp-up the level of our applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now we introduced the building blocks of basic data retirieval with the Eikon Python API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Live Data](https://gcgrossi.github.io/NoMore_Excel_has_stopped_working/Eikonapi_stream_data/)\n",
    "- [Time Series](https://gcgrossi.github.io/NoMore_Excel_has_stopped_working/Eikonapi_timeseries_data/)\n",
    "- [A tool to autostart the Desktop Terminal](https://gcgrossi.github.io/NoMore_Excel_has_stopped_working/Eikonapi_proxy/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples proposed where just snippets of code that you can run in a python executable or in a Jupyter Notebook cell. Sometimes we wrapped some code into a function for a cleaner view of the process, but that's all.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I want to communicate is that all of these elements we introduced are scattered around different lines of code and they do not belong to the same 'entity' (object, for pythonist terminology). We would like to create an object to hold all of these functionalities, so that we can always have them everywhere when we initialize this object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, when writing a new script we could do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_object = object()\n",
    "my_object.connect()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and our new object will do all the leg-work of checking if our Terminal is opened and connecting to it. Our object will also be able to query the data and, if we whish to, manipulate the retrieved data to be presented to our application the way we need it with a more simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_object.get_data()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you didn't get it yet, it's obvious I'm referring to python Classes. We will going to leverage this beatufil kind of object to have our Swiss Army knife of data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Classes are 'portable' objects that can store different kind of variables/data. Those Class variables can be accessed everywhere in the Class, and can be modified by specific Class functions, called 'methods'.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not go into the technical details of how a python Class works, it's not the scope of the guide. But I leave here a list of curated resources where you can find everything you need, written by far more competent people than me.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Official Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) for all the theoretical basis on classes\n",
    "- [Real Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html). A comprehensive tutorial for a pragmatic approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to Python Classes, I suggest you to read at least one of the two to get the general idea of how they work, because from now on we're going to make a deep dive into building our very own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Custom Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a new python file in our current directory. We will call it ```dataclass.py```. There are two basic ways to use our class. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We write the Class in ```dataclass.py``` and our main script in the same file.\n",
    "2. We write the Class in ```dataclass.py``` and our main script in a separate file and import ```dataclass.py``` as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we will use the second methodology for the principle of 'separating corncerns'. In a new file named ```dataclass.py``` let's initialize our Class:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class EikonStreamer():\n",
    "    def __init__(self,app_key,connection=True):\n",
    "        # connect to the eikon terminal\n",
    "        if connection: self.connect(app_key)\n",

    "2. a boolean telling if we want to connect to the eikon terminal\n",
